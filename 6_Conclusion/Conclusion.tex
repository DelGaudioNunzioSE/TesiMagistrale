\chapter{Conclusion}
Given the results of the various tests, we can assert that the problem 
of detecting code generated by LLMs is still not solved. The methods proposed 
in the literature are few, and even fewer are available and actually testable. 
Among the proposed methods, even the best can only achieve a TPR@FPR=10\% that 
is not acceptable in a real-world context. However, this work can be an important 
milestone, clearly demonstrating that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item It is essential to conduct tests only on code without comments to 
avoid contaminating the results with the method's ability to detect natural text.
\item To develop a generally effective code detection method, it is necessary 
to rely on code encoding models, and it is not sufficient to use methods 
based solely on perplexity.
\end{enumerate}
