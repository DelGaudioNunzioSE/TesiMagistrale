\section{Final Evaluation and Perceived Quality}
Although the method selected proved to have the best performance, 
the perceived detection quality is poor: in some cases, the detection method 
tends to classify human code with 100\% probability as LLM. For this reason, 
it cannot be denied that there is considerable room for improvement in LLM 
code detection. This work does not claim to provide a unique and perfect solution 
for LLM code detection but aims to serve as a reference point from which 
improvements in this field can be made.
