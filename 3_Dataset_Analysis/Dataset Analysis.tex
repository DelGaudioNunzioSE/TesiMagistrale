\chapter{Dataset Analysis}

\justifying
The goal of this chapter is to identify or construct a suitable 
dataset to evaluate the performance of the various detection methods 
proposed in the literature. It is worth noting that the literature does 
not only include works specifically aimed at creating benchmark datasets, 
but in several cases, datasets are generated solely for the purpose of 
validating or training the proposed detection methods or models.
