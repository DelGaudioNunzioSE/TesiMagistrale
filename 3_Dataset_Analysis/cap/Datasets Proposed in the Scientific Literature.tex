\section{Datasets Proposed in the Scientific Literature}
The works whose main contribution is the 
creation of a dataset are mostly preprints, 
and thus require careful consideration. 
The papers primarily dedicated to dataset 
generation include: CoDet-M4 \cite{orel2025codet}, 
AIGCodeSet \cite{demirok2024aigcodeset}, 
CodeMirage \cite{guo2025codemirage},
Pan et al \cite{pan2024assessing}.
Suh et al \cite{suh2024empirical}.
