\section{Design Choices}
It was decided to design the text box to recognize programming 
language patterns and allow the code to be displayed in a 
user-friendly manner according to the programming language. 
For this reason, a section was added to select the 
language of the code. The language selection does not affect 
the detection in any way (at least in the current method). 
After entering the code on the right, after a brief loading period, 
the probability that the code was generated by an LLM or written by 
a human will be displayed. The percentage bar changes colour 
depending on the percentage. On the same page, the reasons why an LLM code detector 
is useful are quickly listed.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In the dataset section, every dataset available from Hugging 
Face is automatically downloaded. The purposes for which the 
dataset is recommended for use are provided (for example, AIG 
is recommended for testing the detection method's ability to 
identify competitive code).

Users are also given the option to decide the size of the 
subset they wish to obtain from the dataset. A balanced subset 
is then automatically created based on: LLM generators, 
programming languages, and code correctness. When these 
fields are not present, they are ignored. Additionally, a 
graph is displayed to visually represent the average length 
of code without comments.
