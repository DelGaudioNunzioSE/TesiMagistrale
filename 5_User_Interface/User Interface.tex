\chapter{User Interface}
The user interface was initially designed to resemble any typical 
detector interface, such as GPTZero. The original idea was simply 
to provide a text box where the code to be analysed could be inserted, 
along with a graph to visualize the probability that the code was 
generated by an LLM. However, during the evaluation of the methods, 
it became clear that an effective code detection method does not 
currently exist. For this reason, the project evolved to not only 
allow a user to evaluate a single piece of code, as originally 
intended, but also to enable the retrieval of datasets and the 
testing of methods presented in this work. The motivation behind 
this decision was to avoid repeating the mistakes of some published 
works in this field and to make it extremely simple for any user to 
test and replicate the results obtained.
