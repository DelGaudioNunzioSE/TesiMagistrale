\section{Challenges in LLM-Generated Code Detection}
The detection of short texts generated by LLMs remains 
a challenging task. While partial solutions have been 
proposed, the problem cannot yet be considered fully 
resolved. Nonetheless, it is widely acknowledged that 
detection tools achieve strong performance when applied 
to moderately sized texts (longer than just a few lines).

A well-known example is \textbf{DetectGPT}
\cite{mitchell2023detectgpt}, a 
zero-shot method that does not require training a 
separate classifier but instead relies on an 
auxiliary LLM to assess whether a given passage is 
likely machine-generated. 
DetectGPT is often regarded as the state-of-the-art 
among open-source methods for AI-generated text detection.

However, recent studies have shown that even minimal 
perturbations to LLM-generated outputs can significantly 
reduce detection accuracy, in some cases down to 
42\% \cite{krishna2023paraphrasing}. These findings 
highlight that detection performance is highly 
sensitive to surface-level edits.

In addition to open-source methods, commercial 
solutions such as \href{https://gptzero.me}{GPTZero} 
have gained 
popularity. GPTZero can be accessed via a web 
interface and combines language-model-based heuristics 
with machine learning classifiers. While it is 
effective in many cases, it is not infallible. 
For example, GPTZero has been reported to mistakenly 
flag texts written by non-native speakers, 
whose lexical variety may be lower, as AI-generated.

Even the creators of GPTZero explicitly state 
that a positive detection should not be taken as 
conclusive proof, but rather as a probabilistic 
signal or indicator.

Both GPTZero and DetectGPT offer users the ability to highlight which sections of the input text most strongly contributed to the final classification. This feature, while not always present in detection methods, is particularly valuable as it provides a degree of interpretability that is often lacking in black-box classifiers.
