\chapter{Introduction}


Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly advancing 
branch of AI that, in recent years, has made 
tremendous progress, largely due to the widespread adoption of 
deep learning techniques. Generative models 
are now powerful deep learning architectures capable of producing 
highly realistic text, images, and even video content.


The famous Turing Test is frequently referenced in this context. 
In this test, a human judge had to determine whether they were 
communicating with another human or with a machine. This milestone 
was already surpassed in 2014, with early systems such as Eugene Goostman 
\cite{warwick2016turing}.


Today, it is widely accepted that much of the content generated by 
generative models is indistinguishable from human-produced material
and indeed, for humans, \textbf{this distinction is increasingly difficult 
to make}.


The introduction of the Transformer architecture in 2017 
\cite{vaswani2017attention} revolutionized the field 
and led to the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), 
which quickly became part of everyday life. This wave began 
with the public availability of GPT-3 in June 2020 
\cite{brown2020language}, followed by a growing ecosystem of 
LLMs including GPT-4 \cite{openai2023gpt4}, PaLM 
\cite{chowdhery2022palm}, LLaMA \cite{touvron2023llama}, 
Claude \cite{anthropic2023claude}, and Mistral \cite{jiang2023mistral}.

Generative AI, however, is not limited to natural language 
processing. It has also enabled powerful models for image 
generation, such as Stable Diffusion \cite{rombach2022high}, 
and more recently for video 
synthesis, with systems like Veo-3 \cite{google2024veo}.


Although the usefulness and extraordinary capabilities of these 
tools are undeniable, there are many scenarios in which it becomes 
necessary to have user-friendly tools to detect whether text, images, 
or videos were generated by an AI.

This thesis presents a more modest, yet equally important objective: 
\textbf{detecting artificially generated source code} produced by code generation 
models such as OpenAI Codex \cite{chen2021codex}, GPT-4 \cite{openai2023gpt4}, 
and Code LLaMA \cite{roziere2023code}.


While natural language detectors are well-established and widely 
studied in scientific literature, the detection of AI-generated code 
remains a far less consolidated and more recent research area. 
The contribution of this work is to \textbf{analyze the most relevant 
scientific advancements} made in the past year, which are often fragmented and 
inconsistent due to the unique challenges involved in distinguishing 
machine-generated code, a task that is arguably more complex than natural 
text detection.
