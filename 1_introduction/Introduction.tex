\chapter{Introduction}

The present work pursues an important objective: the
\textbf{detecting artificially generated source code} produced by code generation 
models such as OpenAI Codex \cite{chen2021codex}, GPT-4 \cite{openai2023gpt4}, 
and Code LLaMA \cite{roziere2023code}, StarCoder \cite{li2023starcoder} and many others.


Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly advancing 
branch of AI that, in recent years, has made 
tremendous progress, largely due to the widespread adoption of 
deep learning techniques. Generative models 
are now powerful deep learning architectures capable of producing 
highly realistic text, images, and even video content.


The famous Turing Test is frequently referenced in this context. 
In this test, a human judge had to determine whether they were 
communicating with another human or with a machine. This milestone 
was already surpassed in 2014, with early systems such as Eugene Goostman 
\cite{warwick2016turing}.


Today, it is widely accepted that much of the content generated by 
generative models is indistinguishable from human-produced material
and indeed, for humans, \textbf{this distinction is increasingly difficult 
to make}.


The introduction of the Transformer architecture in 2017 
\cite{vaswani2017attention} revolutionized the field 
and led to the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), 
which quickly became part of everyday life. This wave began 
with the public availability of GPT-3 \cite{brown2020language} 
in June 2020, followed by a growing ecosystem of 
LLMs including GPT-4 \cite{openai2023gpt4}, PaLM 
\cite{chowdhery2022palm}, LLaMA \cite{touvron2023llama}, 
Claude \cite{anthropic2023claude}, and Mistral \cite{jiang2023mistral}.

Generative AI, however, is not limited to natural language 
processing. It has also enabled powerful models for image 
generation, such as Stable Diffusion \cite{rombach2022high}, 
and more recently for video 
synthesis, with systems like Veo-3 \cite{google2024veo}.


Although the usefulness and extraordinary capabilities of these 
tools are undeniable, there are many scenarios in which it becomes 
necessary to have user-friendly tools to detect whether text, images, 
or videos were generated by an AI.
The fields in which AI-generated content detection is relevant 
include: combating disinformation, where highly effective 
generation tools can create videos and photos of events that 
never occurred or are heavily manipulated; preventing fraud 
and scams, for example through phone calls with fake voices 
or video calls with fictitious people; protecting intellectual 
property; and safeguarding education.


While natural language detectors are well-established and widely 
studied in scientific literature, the detection of AI-generated code 
remains a far less consolidated and more recent research area. 

The aim of this thesis is to gather and analyze the scientific contributions 
focused on detecting code generated by LLMs, with the ultimate goal of developing 
a first LLM code detector that is easily usable by a user.

Detection methods for AI-generated text traditionally rely 
on the observation that LLMs tend to generate highly probable 
tokens (probability given by the LLM itself) compared to humans, 
reflecting a unique statistical distribution of tokens in natural 
language.

In the code domain, this logic fails for several reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Grammatical Rigidity: Code adheres to a stricter 
    grammatical structure and rigorous syntactic rules compared to natural language, 
    which can remain coherent while varying widely.
    \item Prevalence of Low-Entropy Tokens: Code is characterized by the 
    presence of numerous “low-entropy” tokens. These are tokens whose choice 
    is often deterministic or has very limited options in a given context.
\end{itemize}
