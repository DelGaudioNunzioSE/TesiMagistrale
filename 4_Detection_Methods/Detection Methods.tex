\chapter{Detection Methods}
Let us recall that the ultimate goal is to build a binary classifier capable of determining whether a piece of source code was written by a human or generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). For binary classifiers, \textbf{accuracy} is typically the default evaluation metric, unless one classification outcome, such as true positives or false positives, is considered more critical than the other. Given that this classifier can be used in scenarios where a programmer could be 'accused' of not having authored the code themselves, it is essential that such claims be made with a high degree of confidence. While it is certainly desirable to allow end users to configure the decision threshold, the default setting should prioritize a \textbf{low FPR} (false positive rate) to prevent unjust accusations.
